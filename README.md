# FreeHandVR

Originally created in our school hackathon, Hack HW 2019.  Won first place.
VR Game in Unity with more immersion via real time xyz hand tracking and hand shape detection (reflects in-game).
Many bugs as of now, but will be smoothed out and hopefully turned into an usable Unity plugin for all.

Games utilizing these features will be developed in separate branch or repo.
